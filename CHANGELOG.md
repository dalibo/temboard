## 8.0

Released 14 november 2022.

!!! warning

    temBoard UI 8.0 is compatible with temBoard agent 7.11 to ease migration.
    Upgrade UI first and then upgrade agents one at a time.

    temBoard agent 8 is **NOT** compatible with temBoard UI 7.11.

    This release requires specific upgrade instructions.
    See [Server Upgrade](server_upgrade.md) and [Agent Upgrade](agent_upgrade.md) for details.


**Breaking changes**

- temBoard UI dropped support for Internet Explorer 8. You may have issues with
  browsers older than 5 years.
- Dropped support for PostgreSQL 9.5 and 9.4. For both UI and agent.
- Dropped key-only authentication on agent. Access to UI grants full access on managed agent.
- New CLI for both UI and agent. `temboard` and `temboard-agent` are the single CLI entrypoints.
    - Removed `temboard --debug` CLI option.
    - Dropped commands `temboard-agent-adduser` and `temboard-agent-password`.
    - Commands `temboard-migratedb`, `temboard-agent-register` are moved as
        subcommands of `temboard` and `temboard-agent`.
- temBoard UI dropped push-metrics handler from pre-6.0 push metric collect.
- temBoard UI RPM does not execute `auto_configure.sh` upon installation.
- temBoard UI RPM does not create `temboard` UNIX user. Use auto_configure.sh
  instead.
- temBoard Agent RPM does not create `postgres` UNIX user. Use PostgreSQL packages instead.
- Packages does not provide logrotate configuration anymore. temBoard can still
  log to file.
- pg_ctl agent parameter must **not** be quoted now, in temboard-agent.conf.
- Agent auto_configure.sh now requires a parameter: the UI url.
- temBoard agent does not provide legacy single-installation systemd unit file
  `temboard-agent.service` in favor of `temboard-agent@.service`.
- temBoard agent debian package does not provide legacy `temboard-agent.init`
  SysV script. Use sytemd instead.
- temBoard agent auto_configure.sh now generates a single configuration file
  instead of `temboard-agent.conf.d/auto.conf`.
- temBoard agent auto_configure.sh does not configure file logging anymore.
- Dropped temBoard agent HTTP endpoint `/monitoring/probe/*`, some
  `/dashboard/` probes and more. Use `temboard routes` and `temboard-agent
  routes` to inspect availables HTTP URLs.
- Docker image for agent now configures agent with `auto_configure.sh`.
  temBoard agent configuration moved from `/etc/temboard-agent` to
  `/etc/temboard-agent/<cluster_name>`.


**Deprecation**

  and [dalibo/temboard-agent].
- Streamlined docker images, basing on Debian Bullseye, with temBoard installed
  with APT instead of pip.

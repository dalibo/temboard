temBoard is a powerful mangement tool for PostgreSQL. You can use it monitor, optimize or configure multiple PostgreSQL instances.

temBoard is composed of 2 basic elements:

- An lightweight agent to install on every PostgreSQL server to monitor and
  manage.
- A central server controlling the agents, collect metrics and present the web
  UI.


You can set up a complete testing environment based on docker by following the
[QUICKSTART](QUICKSTART.md) guide for more details.

We also provide some documentation on how to start a dev environnement for the
UI (server) in case you would like to contribute. See
[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

For a regular installation, follow the [Installation guide](installation.md)

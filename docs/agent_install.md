This page document a quick way of installing the agent. For production
system, you may want to use trusted certificate and other enhancement.

## Prerequisites

In order to run temBoard agent, you need:

- Linux as underlying OS.
- PostgreSQL 9.6+, listening on UNIX socket. Check with
  `sudo -u postgres psql`.
- openssl.
- Python 3.6+. Check with `python --version`.
- bash, curl and sudo for setup script.
- A running temBoard UI.

!!! note

    The temBoard agent must run on the same host as the PostgreSQL instance.
    Running an agent on a remote host is not yet supported.


## Installation

=== "RHEL"

    temBoard RPM are published on [Dalibo Labs YUM repository]. temBoard agent supports
    RHEL/CentOS 7 and 8. Start by enabling Dalibo Labs YUM repository.

    ``` console
    $ sudo yum install -y epel-release
    $ sudo yum install -y https://yum.dalibo.org/labs/dalibo-labs-4-1.noarch.rpm
    ```

    !!! Warning

        Do **NOT** use temBoard agent rpm from PGDG. They are known to be
        broken.

    With the YUM repository configured, you can install temBoard agent with:

    ``` console
    $ sudo yum install temboard-agent
    $ temboard-agent --version
    ```

    **Offline install**

    Some production infrastructure are offline for security reasons. In this
    situation, the temboard-agent package and its dependencies can be dowloaded
    with the following commands :

    ``` console
    $ sudo yum install yum-utils
    $ yumdownloader --resolve --destdir /tmp/temboard-packages temboard-agent
    ```

    Then the downloaded packages can be transfered to the production server and
    installed with

    ``` console
    $ yum --disablerepo=* localinstall *.rpm
    ```

=== "Debian"

    temBoard debs are published on [Dalibo Labs APT
    repository](https://apt.dalibo.org/labs/). temBoard agent supports Debian
    buster and newer. Start by enabling Dalibo Labs APT repository.

    ``` console
    # echo deb http://apt.dalibo.org/labs $(lsb_release -cs)-dalibo main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dalibo-labs.list
    # curl https://apt.dalibo.org/labs/debian-dalibo.asc | apt-key add -
    # apt update  # You may use apt-get here.
    ```

    You can install now temBoard agent with:

    ``` console
    # apt install temboard-agent
    # temboard-agent --version
    ```


=== "PyPI"

    temBoard agent wheel and source tarball are published on
    [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/temboard-agent).

    Installing from PyPI requires Python3.6+, pip and wheel. It\'s better to
    have a recent version of pip.

    ``` console
    $ sudo pip install temboard-agent
    $ temboard-agent --version
    ```

    Note where is installed temBoard agent and determine the prefix. You
    must find a `share/temboard-agent` folder in e.g `/usr` or `/usr/local`.
    If temBoard agent is installed in `/usr/local`, please adapt the
    documentation to match this system prefix.


## Setup one instance

To finish the installation, you will need to follow the next steps for
each Postgres instance on the host:

-   *configure* the agent;
-   *start* the agent;
-   finally *register* it in the UI.

The quickest way to setup temBoard agent is to use the
`auto_configure.sh` script, installed in `/usr/share/temboard-agent`.

You must run this script as root, with `PG*` env vars set to connect to
the Postgres cluster you want to manage. By default, the script uses
`postgres` UNIX user to connect to Postgres cluster.

!!! Note

    Each instance is identified by the fully qualified *hostname*. If
    `hostname --fqdn` can\'t resolve the FQDN of your HOST, simply overwrite
    it using `TEMBOARD_HOSTNAME` envvar. Remember that `localhost` or even a
    short hostname is not enough. `auto_configure.sh` enforces this.

``` console
# /usr/share/temboard-agent/auto_configure.sh https://temboard.acme.tld:8888
```

The script shows you some important information for the next steps:

- agent TCP port (usually 2345 if this is your first agent on this host).
- the path to the main agent configuration file like
  `/etc/temboard-agent/14/main/temboard-agent.conf`

!!! Note

    Some parts of the configuration are in
    `/etc/temboard-agent/14/main/temboard-agent.conf.d/auto.conf` too and
    override the main configuration file.

Next you need to fetch the signing public key of temBoard UI.
An agent accepts requests from a single temBoard UI.
temBoard UI signs each requests using an asymetric key.
Use `temboard-agent fetch-key` to download the signing key from the configured UI.
Or push the signing using a configuration management service.

``` console
# temboard-agent --config /etc/temboard-agent/14/main/temboard-agent.conf fetch-key
```

Now start the agent using the command suggested by `auto_configure.sh`.
On most systems now, it\'s a systemd service:

``` console
# systemctl enable --now temboard-agent@14-main
```

Check that it has started successfully:

``` console
# systemctl status temboard-agent@14-main
```

Now you can register the agent in the UI using
`temboard-agent register`. It needs the configuration file path, the
agent host and port and the path to the temBoard UI.:

``` console
# sudo -u postgres temboard-agent -c /etc/temboard-agent/14/main/temboard-agent.conf register --groups default
```

`temboard-agent register` will ask you credentials to the temBoard UI with
admin privileges.


!!! Note

    temBoard agent OOM score is configured to 15, so that OOM killer will likely kill temBoard agent before Postgres.
    A good practice is to disable memory overcommit on PostgreSQL host by setting sysctl `vm.overcommit_memory = 2`.


## It's up!

Congratulation! You can continue on the UI and see the agent appeared,
and monitoring data being graphed.

You can repeat the above setup for each instance on the same host.

## Cleaning agent installation

If you need to clean a single agent installation either to uninstall it
or to run `auto_configure.sh` again, use `purge.sh` with cluster name.

``` console
# /usr/share/temboard-agent/share/purge.sh 12/main
Stopping and disabling systemd service.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/temboard-agent@12-main.service.
Cleaning files and directories...
removed '/etc/temboard-agent/12/main/temboard-agent.conf'
removed '/etc/temboard-agent/12/main/temboard-agent.conf.d/auto.conf'
removed directory '/etc/temboard-agent/12/main/temboard-agent.conf.d'
removed '/etc/temboard-agent/12/main/users'
removed directory '/etc/temboard-agent/12/main/'
removed directory '/var/lib/temboard-agent/12/main/'
temBoard agent 12-main stopped and cleaned.

Temboard is designed to interact with many components: systemd, PostgreSQL,
agents, etc.

As we are trying to find the right balance between innovation and backward
compatibility, we define a comprehensive list of platforms and software that
we support for each version.

Temboard 8 was released in May 2022.

Each minor release (e.g. `8.1`, `8.2`, etc.) is compatible with the following
components:


|                |                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Linux          | Debian 9 up to 11, RHEL 7 and 8 |
| Python         | 3.6+                            |
| Postgres       | 10 to 14                        |
| Temboard Agent | 7.11 and 8.2                    |

For older systems, you may use [temBoard v7](/en/v7).

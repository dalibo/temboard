<h1>Install the server</h1>

temBoard is designed with three distinct components:

- **repository** - a Postgres database to store users, instances list and
 monitoring data.
- **UI** - the main web interface.
- **agent** - a standalone daemon attached to a single Postgres cluster to manage.


The following diagram illustrates the global architecture of temBoard.

![temBoard architecture](sc/architecture.png)

This document guides you to quickly setup all these components together.


# Prerequisites

temBoard UI requires:

- Python 3.6+.
- openssl
- bash, sudo and psql for setup script.


# Prepare repository

Before installing temBoard UI, ensure you have a running PostgreSQL 9.6+
cluster. The auto-configuration script works well with a local Postgres cluster,
running as UNIX user `postgres`. If it's not the case, post-inst script will
fail gracefully and let you handle the configuration later.

!!! note

    To ensure browsing of the web interface is fast enough, please note `work_mem`
    parameter PostgreSQL cluster hosting the repository should be set to at least
    `16MB`.

A simple way to check if auto configuration should work is to run:

``` console
# sudo -u postgres psql
```

If this fails, don't worry. You will have to run auto-configuration script with
proper parameters, once temBoard package is installed.


# Installation


=== "RHEL"

    temBoard RPM are published on [Dalibo Labs YUM
    repository](https://yum.dalibo.org/labs/). temBoard supports RHEL / CentOS 7
    & 8. Start by enabling Dalibo Labs YUM repository.

    ``` console
    $ sudo yum install -y epel-release
    $ sudo yum install -y https://yum.dalibo.org/labs/dalibo-labs-4-1.noarch.rpm
    ```

    !!! warning

        Do **NOT** use temBoard rpm from PGDG. They are known to be broken.

    With the YUM repository configured, you can install temBoard UI with:

    ``` console
    $ sudo yum install temboard
    $ temboard --version
    ```

    **Offline install**

    Some production infrastructure are offline for security reasons. In this
    situation, the temboard package and its dependencies can be dowloaded with
    the following commands :

    ``` console
    $ sudo yum install yum-utils
    $ yumdownloader --resolve --destdir /tmp/temboard-packages temboard
    ```

    Then the downloaded packages can be transfered to the production server and
    installed with

    ``` console
    $ yum --disablerepo=* localinstall *.rpm
    ```


=== "Debian"

    temBoard debs are published on [Dalibo Labs APT
    repository](https://apt.dalibo.org/labs/). temBoard supports Debian *bookworm*,
    *bullseye* and *buster*. Start by enabling Dalibo Labs APT
    repository.


    ``` console
    # echo deb http://apt.dalibo.org/labs $(lsb_release -cs)-dalibo main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dalibo-labs.list
    # curl https://apt.dalibo.org/labs/debian-dalibo.asc | apt-key add -
    # apt update
    ```

    You can now install temBoard with:

    ``` console
    # apt install temboard
    # temboard --version
    ```


=== "PyPI"

    temBoard UI wheel and source tarball are published on
    [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/temboard). Installing from PyPI requires
    Python3.6, pip and wheel. It's better to have a recent version of pip.

    Due to the [binary strategy of
    psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/articles/2018/02/08/psycopg-274-released/)
    project, you have to choose how to install psycopg2: either from source (using
    `psycopg2` package) or from binary (using `psycopg2-binary` package). You can
    also use distribution package instead.

    ``` console
    $ sudo pip install temboard psycopg2-binary
    $ temboard --version
    ```

    !!! note "temBoard installation prefix"

        temBoard installation prefix may differ from one system to another, e.g. `/usr`
        or `/usr/local`. Please adapt the documentation to match this system prefix.

    Now run manually the auto configuration script:

    ``` console
    $ sudo /usr/local/share/temboard/auto_configure.sh
    ```


# Post installation

If postinst auto-configuration fails, you can still relaunch it with proper
parameters. Call the script `/usr/share/temboard/auto_configure.sh` with
libpq-style envvars (eg.Â `sudo PGPORT=5433 /usr/share/temboard/auto_configure.sh`).

The postinst script creates Postgres role, database and tables, as
well as self-signed SSL certificate, UNIX user, configuration file and systemd
unit. A few steps are left to the administrator.

The configuration file `/etc/temboard/temboard.conf` should suit most people.
See [Configuration](server_configure.md) and customize if default port
or directories don't match your local needs, or increase security by changing
the certificate and the cookie secret key.

!!! danger "Default admin user"

    By default, temBoard is set up with a dumb `admin` user with password `admin`. This
    is totally unsecured. It is **strongly recommended to change default password**! See below.

First, start temboard using `systemctl enable --now temboard`.

You may need to open port using :

``` console
$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-port 8888/tcp --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Adapt to your setup.
Then point your browser to <https://temboard_server_host:8888>, log in as
`admin:admin` and change the password.

!!! note "Using firewall"
    To increase security, you may protect temBoard using
    a firewall rule, until the quickstart admin is secured.

# Install agents

Once the UI is up and running, you can proceed to agent installation and setup
on each host you want to manage. See the dedicated [agent installation](agent_install.md)
documentation for this.

Then, when all instances show up in temBoard, go further with the [How
to](temboard-howto.md).

          In temBoard 9.0, we plan to remove the ability to put an instance group in several user groups. Each group of
          instance will be associated to a single user group. To prepare the upgrade, review your configuration to put
          this group in a single user group.

          In temBoard 9.0, we plan to remove the ability to put an instance in several groups of instances. Each
          instance will be associated to a single group of instances called <em>Environment</em>. To prepare the
          upgrade, review your configuration to put this instance in a single group of instances.
        </p>
        <p>temBoard 9.0 upgrade will create an <em>environment</em> per combination of groups of instance.</p>
